       <p><br>The First Tech Challenge is a robotics competition for middle school and high school students. Each year, a new game is announced to teams and their job is to design a robot that will score the most points in the game. For the 2022-2023, Powerplay was the announced game for the season. Multiple awards can be awarded to teams like the Inspire Award or Think Award and teams also have to chance to win competitons in head-to-head events and the objective is to score the most points during each game <br><br><br></p>

        <p> Powerplay is a 2 minute and 30 second game that is separated into a 30 second autonomous period and a 2 minute driver-controlled period. Pairs of teams go against one another and the objective is to score cones onto junctions or ground junctions. A cone on a ground junction is 2 points, on a small it's 3, medium is 4, and a high junction score is 5 points all during the driver period. During autonomous points are worth double. <br>
          During autonomous, teams that can scan a custom sleeve on a cone and park in the correct signal zone earn 20 points during autnonmous. Lastly, the final 30 seconds are called the endgame. Teams can prevent other teams from scoring on a junction by scoring a beacon on a junction only during the last 30 seconds. Those are just some of the ways to score in Powerplay. 
         <br> For additional imformation, watch the video on the right. <br>
          </p> 
         <!-- <p>The start of the game is marked by a 30 second autonomous period. Robots must move uncontrolled during the autonomous period and cones scored are worth double the points. Teams that can scan a custom sleeve on a cone and park in the correct signal zone earn 20 points during autnonmous. The 2 minute period is driver controlled and cones are worth the regular 2-3 points. The last 30 seconds are called the endgame. Teams can prevent other teams from scoring on a junction by scoring a beacon on a junction only during the last 30 seconds.   </p>-->
